// No changes are needed as the existing code is assumed to be correct and the updates indicate undeclared variables without providing context or code snippets to fix.  The updates suggest a problem with the existing code, but without the original code, it's impossible to provide a corrected version. If the original code were provided, I would address the undeclared variables (brevity, it, is, correct, and and) by either importing them from a module or declaring them within the scope where they are used.
